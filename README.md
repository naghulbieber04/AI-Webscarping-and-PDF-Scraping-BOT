Notes:
Initially You will find execution errors to add the env file, it is the api key to access gemini bot to proces the scraping process,
 add api key as .env file to the same location where the python file is located and edit the main and app py files as per your gemini version.
This is a basic insight about building a chatbot using basic Streamlit version, hop you like it!
